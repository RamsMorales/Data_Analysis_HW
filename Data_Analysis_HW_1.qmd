### a) What is the subject, sample, population?

i\) Subject: The subject is an exit poll participant for the CNN exit poll.

ii\) Sample: In this scenario, the sample is 1882 voters in California that were surveyed for this exit poll.

iii\) The population is the set of all California voters in the 2018 election.

### b) Identify a relevant statistic and corresponding parameter.

Based on the question, a relevant statistic x, is the percent of voters in the sample who voted for the democratic candidate

$$
x = 0.525 \times1882\text{ voters} = \frac{ 989\text{ sample voters who voted for Feinstein}}{ 1882\text{ total sample voters}} \approx 52.5\%
$$

Since this represents the percent of voters who voted for Feinstein in the sample. This proportion estimates the population parameter, $\rho$, which is the 54.2% of all California voters in the 2018 election that voted for Feinstein.
